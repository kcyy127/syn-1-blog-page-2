<p><span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/theres-still-time-to-fix-climate-about-11-years/" target="_blank">10 years.</a></span> That’s the estimated time scientists give for us to respond to the climate crisis.  That’s when our unregulated use of resources, ceaseless burning of fossil fuels, and indifference towards other inhabitants of the planet officially accumulate damages to the degree they become irreversible. That’s when the desertification of our croplands become preordained, the release of historic diseases and plagues from ice caps inevitable, and formation of a death smog consisting of elevated carbon dioxide levels, ozone, and fossil-fuel particles destined. </p>
<p>Where would we be in 10 years? For the majority of my peers, young adults in their late twenties by then, we would probably have yet to settle down for a permanent job. We likely would still be exploring the world, experimenting with different career paths, struggling to be financially independent, and hustling for our dream lifestyle. We would be renting with our friends or partners, and half of us would have yet to commit to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/average-marriage-age-united-states-2019-2" target="_blank">marriage</a>. Our lives, both personal and professional, would have just taken off, and a time filled with such uncertainty and hope, would be, sooner or later, drained of all its potential as the planet plunged into its doom. </p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to happen that way. </p>
<br>

<h4>Wielding Capitalism </h4>
<p>For the past decades, it may seem that capitalism is to blame for the ever-prospering operations of fossil fuel giants and their acquisition of unmatched financial and political power. Pushing oil giants to maximize profits regardless of the environmental repercussions, capitalism appears to have fueled humanity’s unparalleled rate in exploiting resources. However, contrary to this line of reasoning, I argue that it is not our economic system that allowed for the rampant activities of the fossil fuel companies. Rather, the culprit behind the climate crisis is strategic, deliberate, long-term efforts that have worked to alter public opinion, a major influence on the market, and which consequently gave way to a dysfunctional economic system incapable of accurately reflecting the best interests of the people. </p>
<p>When scientific studies regarding the adverse effects of fossil fuels first emerged in the 1980s, the fossil fuel industry immediately recognized their potential to drastically increase oil prices, and possibly one day, to wipe the world clean of the whole industry. Thus, the fossil fuel giants wielded their power both financially and politically to prevent the public from realizing the devastating perils of burning fossil-fuels. Ranging anywhere from fabricating “alternative” truths, politicizing environmental issues, to employing lobbying agencies to guide <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/CBO9780511762154A016/type/book_part" target="_blank">legislation</a>, the efforts of the fossil-fuel industry have largely paid off to create a misinformed general public that permit them to continue profiting off environmental expenses in which they have no intention of paying off. </p>
<p>Capitalism functions to minimize cost and maximize profit. However, costs are human defined, so when companies fail to acknowledge incurred costs, they leave problems and waste behind for others to clean up. The side effects of our daily activities such as resource depletion, pollution, and global warming are arguably costs. As defined in economic terms, a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cost" target="_blank">cost</a> is the outlay or expenditure (as of effort or sacrifice) made to achieve an object. As we devour ever increasing amounts of meat, drive gas-powered vehicles, and consume electricity derived from fossil-fuels, enjoying the comforts and conveniences brought by these fruits of capitalism, we risk raising the planet’s temperature to unnatural levels and shattering the delicate current balance of ecosystems. The fact that these catastrophic outcomes are immensely delayed does not deny their status as expenses. Over the past decades, we have, both knowingly and unknowingly, contributed to the accumulation of environmental damages along with the oil giants, and it’s time we rightfully acknowledge them in association to our activities. </p>
<p>Profit drives decision-making in businesses. Therefore, incorporation of environmental damages as costs would compel companies to abandon practices that destroy our planet for greener alternatives less harmful to our environment. If the climate crisis is successfully acknowledged as a real expenditure, companies will naturally resort to lower-priced alternatives such as investing in sustainable energy and financing environment-friendly projects. Weakening the fossil-fuel industry’s long-held influence and enabling green technologies to compete within the open market, the world may allow the world to finally welcome the emergence of a truly efficacious, viable form of alternative energy that could fundamentally transform life as we know it. </p>
<p>How then, exactly, would we go about making companies incorporate environmental costs in their accounting journals? The answer: divestment. </p>
<br>

<h4>Banks & Divestment</h4>
<p>As author Bill McKibben makes more than explicit in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/money-is-the-oxygen-on-which-the-fire-of-global-warming-burns" target="_blank">“Money Is the Oxygen on Which the Fire of Global Warming Burns,”</a> the key to defeating fossil fuel giants, to stop further exploitation of non-renewable resources and destruction of the planet, is to cut the industry’s funding, to block their resources which have allowed them to operate thus far. Divestment would act as the manifestation of consumers calling for a more habitable future for the planet, translating the market’s desires into monetary terms, and forcing corporations to acknowledge and act on these demands. Moreover, not only would divestment help to curb the fossil fuel companies’ activities, it would free up capital that could be used to invest in developing alternative, eco-friendly energy sources, a key to helping humanity with the desperately-needed transition away from its lethal dependence on fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Banks finance a considerable portion of the fossil fuel industry. According to <a href="https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf" target="_blank">“Banking on Climate Chaos, Fossil Fuel Financing Report 2021”</a> produced by the Rainforest Action Network, in 2020 alone, private sector banks financed a total of 751 billion dollars into the fossil fuel industry. In the five years since the Paris Agreement, the trend of fossil fuel financing has, in actuality, gone up, totaling to 3.8 trillion dollars in investments over the period. Among all the financial institutions that have been profiting off the destruction of the planet, the top three financers have been JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, and Wells Fargo, respectively. Worthy of note, JP Morgan Chase leads its runner-up by a whopping 33 percent. </p>
<p>Convincing banks to drastically change financing decisions would be difficult, more so with billions of dollars at stake. However, the younger generation, especially college students, have a certain power over these fossil-fuel investing financial institutions. </p>
<br>

<h4>A Juicy Market</h4>
<p>With the average undergraduate starting salary at around <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/uploadedfiles/files/2021/publication/executive-summary/2021-nace-salary-survey-summer-executive-summary.pdf" target="_blank">$55,000</a>, college students exist as a valuable, lucrative potential consumer group to brands and businesses. Moreover, because most 18- to 22-year-olds have just gained independence and have not established spending habits and brand loyalties, their high levels of impressionability serve as opportunities for companies establish corporate images early on and bring in <a href="https://www.aaaa.org/index.php?checkfileaccess=/wp-content/uploads/legacy-pdfs/CollegeMarketing101.pdf" target="_blank">lifelong customers</a>. Fresh graduates are present as potential, long-term customers that have the possibility of staying in business for the future 40 to 60 years. Additionally, the nature of college students as a highly interactive group of individuals allows for good experiences with brands to spread within family, friends and classmates, amplifying the companies’ marketing efforts. </p>
<p>Banks, too, are fully <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/banks-battle-for-college-students-to-secure-a-generation-of-clients-55548169" target="_blank">aware</a> of the status of college students as a prominent customer group. Walk into any university on the first day of school, and you’ll see, next to the academic clubs and Greek life enthusiastically screaming at you, a handful of banks lined up in canopy tents to vigorously convince you to open an account with them, their deals embellished with discounts, gifts cards, souvenirs, etc. Young adults which have just gained independence and now needing to build their previously non-existent financial profile are a huge opportunity for banks, as it is a great chance for them to reap in future customers of decades to come. </p>
<p>The power college students hold, therefore, over the financial institutions is their right and freedom to choose which banks they do businesses with. The same cannot be said about those long been in the work force who already have had their electric and water bills, credit cards, direct deposits, and other incoming and outgoing money <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-switch-banks-315430" target="_blank">tangled with their bank accounts</a>. Starting with a completely blank slate, college students can opt for environmentally friendly alternatives at a much lower cost which don’t make them accomplices in the <a href="https://mightydeposits.com/posts/environmentally-friendly-banks" target="_blank">expansion of fossil-fuel practices and infrastructures</a>. Most importantly, the loss of a whole generation of clients will surely cause substantial harm to major banks who will have to revisit their financing decisions and incorporate environmental interests as a cost. </p>
<p>Granted, using second-tier banks and credit unions may be inconvenient, with less branch presence, fewer ATM machines, and limited services and products. The extra time and effort you spend on the tasks that would’ve taken no more than the bat of an eye at a major commercial bank might even cost you real, quantifiable amounts of money. However, these inconveniences are dwarfed by the costs of climate change. Research predicts every degree Celsius of warming to cost, on average, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html" target="_blank">1.2 percent of GDP</a>, and the total damages by the end of this century to be up to <a href="https://thischangeseverything.org/book/" target="_blank">551 trillion dollars</a>, an entire whole order of magnitude greater than the 2008 financial crisis. If the thought of losing money already is intolerable, an even worse outcome exists: losing all your money. If the climate crisis continues down its current trajectory, our homeless, starving, and unbreathable future will have no use for currency and economic data. By then, we will be exchanging goods with food, all struggling to survive under harsh, extreme weather and scrambling for the last few habitable pockets on Earth. </p>
<br>

<p>As Uncle Ben said to Peter Parker, “with great power comes great responsibility.” With the influence that we, college students as a whole, hold over banks, we are also burdened with the responsibility to reshape our financial institutions, to either force current supporters for fossil fuels to change their financing decisions or fundamentally restructure the current financial landscape. If we are to have any hope in a livable, sustainable future where career chasing and family building are to amount to anything, we must take action now and revert the tide before it’s too late. </p>
